# Deploy to Vercel (web) and Railway (backend) on every push to main.
# Requires GitHub repo to have network; run from your machine: git push origin main
#
# One-time setup: Add these secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
#   - VERCEL_TOKEN (from vercel.com/account/tokens)
#   - VERCEL_ORG_ID (from .vercel/project.json or Vercel dashboard)
#   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (from .vercel/project.json or Vercel dashboard)
#   - RAILWAY_TOKEN (from railway.app/account/tokens, or use Railway GitHub integration instead)
#
# If you use Vercel/Railway GitHub integration (repo connected in their dashboards),
# you can leave this workflow as a backup or remove it — push to main will already deploy.
