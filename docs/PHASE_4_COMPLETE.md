# Phase 4: Operational Lock-In & Buying Triggers
## Status: Core Features Complete, Testing Phase Initiated

---

## Completed Features

### Track 1: Time-to-Value Compression ✅

#### 1. First-Run Setup Wizard ✅
**Location**: `components/setup/FirstRunSetupWizard.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Asks 3 things: Industry, Number of sites, Primary buyer role
- Auto-configures: Playbooks, Default proof pack, Demo data cleared → live mode
- Makes the product feel purpose-built, not configurable

**Integration**: Integrated into `app/operations/page.tsx` to show on first run.

---

#### 2. "Create Job → Proof Pack" Shortcut ✅
**Location**: `app/operations/jobs/new/page.tsx`

**What it does**:
- One CTA: "Create & Generate Proof Pack →"
- Under the hood: Creates job, applies playbook, opens Job Packet view immediately
- Anchors value to outputs, not setup

**User flow**: Job creation page → Quick action button → Direct to proof pack view

---

### Track 2: Executive & Buyer Surfaces ✅

#### 3. Executive Snapshot View ✅
**Location**: `app/operations/executive/page.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Single read-only page showing:
  - ⚠️ Flagged jobs
  - 🔴 High-risk jobs
  - 🚨 Open incidents
  - ✅ Signed vs unsigned jobs
  - 📊 Recent violations
- No actions. No clutter.
- For people who approve budgets.

**Navigation**: Added to `DashboardNavbar` for owner/admin/executive roles.

---

### Track 3: Enterprise Polish Framework ✅

#### 4. Clarity, Accountability, Provenance ✅
**Applied across**:
- **Job Packet View**: Added "Why This Exists" legal artifact context
- **Audit View**: "Governance Enforcement Events" language
- **Job Roster**: UTC timestamps, governance language in tooltips
- **Risk Score Tooltips**: Visibility escalation explanations

**Framework lenses applied**:
- ✅ Clarity (zero confusion)
- ✅ Accountability (who owns this?)
- ✅ Provenance (where did this come from?)
- ✅ Irreversibility (can this be quietly undone?)
- ✅ Export Credibility (does it survive outside the app?)
- ✅ Silence (nothing unnecessary)

## Pending Testing Feedback

### External Proof Share
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending buyer signal

**Why wait**: Only build if buyers explicitly ask for external sharing. If proof packs are clear enough, they may export PDFs directly.

**What it would be**:
- Read-only, expiring links for insurance/audit/incident packets
- Watermarked: "Generated by RiskMate • Read-only • Timestamped"
- Controlled access with audit logging

---

### Governance-Aligned Pricing Tiers
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending value anchor identification

**Why wait**: Need to understand what buyers perceive as valuable (governance vs. exports vs. visibility) before structuring tiers.

**What it would be**:
- Core Ops / Governance / Enterprise tiers
- Gated features: PDF exports, audit depth, external sharing, sign-offs, retention
- Pricing aligned to governance depth, not headcount

---

## Testing Framework

**See**: `docs/TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`

**Key tests**:
1. Demo + Executive Snapshot perception ("At what point did this feel expensive?")
2. Proof Pack comprehension ("If you had to send one thing to an insurer tomorrow, what would you send?")
3. Role perception ("Does this feel like something your team uses, or something you rely on?")

**Timeline**: 7-10 days, 5-10 people

---

## What's NOT Being Built (Yet)

Per strategic guidance:
- ❌ Analytics charts (unless they justify decisions)
- ❌ AI suggestions (unless buyers ask)
- ❌ Workflow automations (that create noise)
- ❌ Notifications everywhere (power is quiet authority)

**Principle**: If a change does not increase trust, defensibility, or clarity under scrutiny — don't ship it.

---

## Strategic Shift

**Before**: "What should I add?"
**Now**: "What should I wait to learn?"

RiskMate is now in **product mode**, not builder mode. Testing gives signal. Building more without feedback gives noise.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test for 7-10 days** (see `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`)
2. **Synthesize feedback** (2-3 days)
3. **Build based on signal** (External Proof Share or pricing, if asked)
4. **Re-test refined version** (if major changes made)
