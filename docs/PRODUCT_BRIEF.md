## What RiskMate Does

RiskMate is **compliance software for contractors** that documents workplace safety, calculates risk scores, and generates audit-ready reports for inspectors, insurers, and legal protection.

**Core Value:** Turn safety documentation from a liability into a competitive advantage.

---

## Who It's For

**Primary:** Construction contractors, tradespeople, project managers  
**Secondary:** Safety officers, compliance managers, insurance brokers  
**Enterprise:** Multi-site contractors, general contractors, safety consultancies

---

## The Problem We Solve

1. **Inspector Anxiety:** "Did I document everything? Will this hold up in court?"
2. **Insurance Claims:** "We need proof of safety measures taken."
3. **Legal Protection:** "Show me the audit trail of who did what, when."
4. **Repeat Work:** "I do the same job type 50 times—why recreate the safety plan each time?"

---

## How RiskMate Works (Simple)

1. **Create Job** → Enter client, location, job type
2. **Identify Hazards** → Select from 100+ workplace hazards (or use template)
3. **Auto-Calculate Risk** → System generates risk score (0-100) and required safety controls
4. **Track Mitigation** → Check off safety measures as completed
5. **Upload Evidence** → Photos, documents, permits
6. **Generate Report** → One-click PDF for inspectors/insurers
7. **Permit Pack** (Business) → ZIP archive with everything for permit offices

**Result:** Complete, timestamped, audit-ready documentation in minutes instead of hours.
