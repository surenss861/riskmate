# PDF Packet Improvements - Implementation Status

## Summary

Starting with **Compliance Packet** improvements focusing on:
1. Conditional rendering (skip empty sections)
2. Defensible empty-state messaging
3. Executive Summary section
4. Basic structure improvements

## Quick Start Recommendation

**Start with Compliance Packet** because:
- Most visible issues (empty sections everywhere)
- Quickest impact (fewer sections to fix)
- Tests foundation patterns for other packets

Then proceed with Insurance → Audit → Incident as needed.

## Implementation Plan

See `PDF_PACKET_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` for full roadmap.
