# RiskMate Testing Framework
## Validation Checkpoint - January 2025

**Status**: Ready for buyer validation before further feature expansion

---

## Strategic Context

RiskMate has completed the core adoption loop:
- ✅ First-run setup wizard (reduces friction)
- ✅ Job → Proof Pack shortcut (value realization)
- ✅ Executive Snapshot (budget-holder relevance)
- ✅ Governance enforcement (differentiation)
- ✅ Demo (sales-grade, not toy-grade)

**Next Phase**: Test what's built before building amplifiers (External Proof Share, pricing tiers).

---

## Testing Objectives (7-10 Day Window)

### Test 1: Demo + Executive Snapshot Perception
**Question to ask**: "At what point did this feel expensive?"

**Signal interpretation**:
- "When I saw audit violations" → Pricing anchor = governance depth
- "When I saw proof packs" → Pricing anchor = export capabilities
- "When I saw exec view" → Pricing anchor = leadership visibility

**Outcome**: Determines how to structure governance-aligned pricing tiers.

---

### Test 2: Proof Pack Comprehension
**Question to ask**: "If you had to send one thing to an insurer tomorrow, what would you send?"

**Signal interpretation**:
- **Hesitation** → Proof Pack UI needs clarity improvements
- **Instant answer** → Ready for External Proof Share feature

**Outcome**: Validates whether proof pack flow is intuitive or needs refinement.

---

### Test 3: Role Perception
**Question to ask executives**: "Does this feel like something your team uses, or something you rely on?"

**Signal interpretation**:
- **"Me" (executive)** → Pricing should be exec-facing, not per-seat
- **"Team"** → Pricing can stay usage-based

**Outcome**: Decides governance-aligned pricing model (executive vs. operational).

---

## Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Demo Walkthrough (5-10 people, 7-10 days)

**What to do**:
1. Use the `/demo` page
2. Walk through without explaining
3. Watch reactions silently

**What to capture**:
- Where they pause (confusion points)
- What they ask about (value gaps)
- What they repeat back in their own words (perceived value)

**Documentation format**:
```
Date: [Date]
Person: [Role/Title]
Industry: [Vertical]

Pauses:
- [Timestamp] - [What they paused on]

Questions:
- [Question] - [Context]

Own words:
- "[Exact quote]" - [What they understood]

Value anchor:
- [What made it feel expensive/valuable]
```

---

### Step 2: Decision Framework (After Testing)

**If they ask "Can I share this externally?"**
→ Build External Proof Share (Track 2, remaining)

**If they ask "How much does this cost?"**
→ Lock governance-aligned pricing (Track 3)

**If they ask neither**
→ Tighten clarity, not features (Enterprise Polish refinement)

## Features Pending Testing Feedback

### 1. External Proof Share
**Status**: Pending buyer signal

**What it would be**:
- Read-only, expiring links for insurance/audit/incident packets
- Watermarked: "Generated by RiskMate • Read-only • Timestamped"
- Controlled access with audit logging

**Why wait**: Only build if buyers explicitly ask for external sharing. If proof packs are clear enough, they may export PDFs directly.

---

### 2. Governance-Aligned Pricing Tiers
**Status**: Pending value anchor identification

**What it would be**:
- Core Ops / Governance / Enterprise tiers
- Gated features: PDF exports, audit depth, external sharing, sign-offs, retention
- Pricing aligned to governance depth, not headcount

**Why wait**: Need to understand what buyers perceive as valuable (governance vs. exports vs. visibility) before structuring tiers.

---

## What NOT to Build (Yet)

❌ **Analytics charts** (unless they justify decisions)
❌ **AI suggestions** (unless buyers ask)
❌ **Workflow automations** (that create noise)
❌ **Notifications everywhere** (power is quiet authority)

**Principle**: If a change does not increase trust, defensibility, or clarity under scrutiny — don't ship it.

---

## Success Metrics

**Testing is successful if**:
1. At least 3 buyers can articulate value in their own words
2. At least 1 buyer asks about pricing or external sharing
3. Executive Snapshot resonates with budget-holders
4. Proof Pack flow is understood without explanation

**Testing indicates need for refinement if**:
1. Multiple people pause at the same point
2. Questions reveal confusion about core concepts
3. No one asks about pricing or sharing
4. Executives don't see relevance to their role

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Synthesize feedback** (2-3 days)
   - Identify patterns in pauses/questions
   - Map value anchors to pricing structure
   - Document clarity gaps

2. **Build based on signal** (not assumptions)
   - External Proof Share (if asked)
   - Governance pricing (if value anchor clear)
   - Clarity improvements (if confusion found)

3. **Re-test refined version** (if major changes made)

---

## The Real Signal

**Builders ask**: "What should I add?"

**Product leaders ask**: "What should I wait to learn?"

RiskMate is now in product mode. Testing gives signal. Building more without feedback gives noise.
