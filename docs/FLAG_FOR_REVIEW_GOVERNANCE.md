# Flag for Review: Governance Signal

**Strategic Context: This is a governance signal, not a task.**

## The Core Function

"Flagged for review" answers one question instantly:

**"Should someone senior look at this before we move forward?"**

## What It Actually Does

### Operationally

When a job is Flagged for review:

- It's explicitly marked as requiring oversight
- It becomes visible to:
  - Safety leads
  - Managers
  - Exec / Executive View users
- It does not auto-block work, but it removes plausible deniability

**In other words:**

You can still proceed — but the system remembers that someone chose to proceed after a warning existed.

### Governance-Wise

This is not about productivity.

This is about accountability and audit trails.

"Flagged for review" creates:

- A decision checkpoint
- A recorded moment of awareness
- A clear escalation path

If something goes wrong later, RiskMate can show:

**"This job was flagged. A review opportunity existed."**

That's insurer-grade logic.

## What It Is NOT

This is NOT:

- ❌ A to-do item
- ❌ A nag notification
- ❌ A red alert or panic state
- ❌ A blocker that halts operations

Those things create noise and resentment.

This instead creates institutional memory:

**"At this point in time, risk crossed a threshold and visibility was raised."**

That's it. Clean. Serious. Defensible.

## How to Explain It

### To Operators
"It means this job needs a second set of eyes."

### To Managers
"It's how we surface risk before it becomes an incident."

### To Execs
"It's our internal escalation signal — before exposure turns into liability."

### To Insurers / Auditors
"It documents when elevated risk was identified and governance was applied."

## Current Implementation

- Appears inline in "Next Action" column for Medium+ risk jobs (≥40)
- Subtle text link, not a button
- Non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight
- Creates a governance checkpoint without blocking operations

## Who It Goes To

**"Flagged for review" goes to the role that owns risk, not the person doing the work.**

In RiskMate terms, that is:
- Safety Lead
- Risk Manager
- Project Executive / Ops Director
- Org Owner (fallback)

**Not:**
- ❌ "Who created the job"
- ❌ "Who last touched it"
- ❌ "Everyone"

It goes to the role accountable for exposure.

## What "Goes To Them" Actually Means

**Right now, nothing is sent. And that's good.**

In enterprise systems, "goes to" does not mean:
- ❌ Slack ping
- ❌ Email blast
- ❌ Notification badge
- ❌ Task assignment

It means:

**"This appears in the places this role already looks."**

That's how serious systems work.

## The Correct Mental Model

Think of Flagged for review as a **visibility signal, not a delivery mechanism**.

You're not saying:
- "Hey, do this task."

You're saying:
- **"If you are accountable for risk, this is now in your field of view."**

That's the difference between:
- Institutional software
- Productivity apps

## Clean Architecture

### Step 1: Define a Single Accountable Role

Pick one canonical role:
```
RISK_ACCOUNTABLE_ROLE = "Safety Lead"
```

Later this can be configurable, but hardcode it for now.

This does two things:
- Removes ambiguity
- Prevents feature creep

### Step 2: Make Flagged for Review a Queryable State

Not a notification. A state.

Example:
```javascript
job.review_flag = {
  flagged: true,
  flagged_at: timestamp,
  reason: "risk_threshold_exceeded"
}
```

That's it. No assignee. No workflow.

### Step 3: Surface It Where That Role Lives

This is where it "goes to them" without sending anything.

For Safety Leads / Execs:
- Executive View shows flagged jobs first
- Optional filter: "Flagged for review"
- Subtle badge or icon in Job Roster
- Appears in any risk summary/export

They discover it during normal review, which is exactly what auditors expect.

## Simple v1 Implementation

If you want a concrete v1 that's still clean:

1. Flag sets `review_flag = true`
2. Executive View auto-filters flagged jobs to the top
3. Add tooltip text: "Visible to Safety Leads and executives"

That alone answers:
- Who it's for
- Why it exists
- How it's governed

No backend routing required yet.

## Optional (Later): One Quiet Nudge, Not a System

When you're ready — and only then — add one of these:

### Option A: Digest, not alert (recommended)

Daily or weekly email:
- "2 jobs flagged for review since last check"
- No urgency. No panic. Just awareness.

### Option B: Dashboard counter

- "3 jobs awaiting review"
- Only visible to the accountable role
- Still no assignment. Still no task.

## What You Should NOT Do

🚫 Assign it to a user  
🚫 Require acknowledgement  
🚫 Block job progress  
🚫 Add notifications everywhere  
🚫 Turn it into a checklist item  

Those moves shift you from:
- Risk ledger
- to
- Workflow tool

And insurers hate workflow theater.

## The Rule to Keep Forever

Only add "delivery" when a buyer asks:

**"How do we prove leadership saw this?"**

Then — and only then — you add:
- `reviewed_by`
- `reviewed_at`

Still no tasks. Still no workflow.

## Why This Is Good Product Work

You didn't add a feature.

You added a moment of accountability.

That's why this feels:
- Expensive
- Serious
- Non-DIY
- Insurable

## Potential Enhancements (Future)

### Strategic Decision: Keep As-Is For Now

**Do not implement enhancements yet.**

The current implementation is exactly where high-trust enterprise software should pause.

### Evaluation of Proposed Enhancements

#### A) Tighten when it appears (threshold logic)

**Status: 🚫 Do NOT do this yet**

**Why:**
- Thresholds are political
- Buyers argue about them
- You'll end up tuning knobs instead of selling

**Current rule is perfect:**
- "Medium+ risk gets visibility."
- Simple, explainable, defensible
- Perfect for early enterprise sales

**Only revisit when:**
- A buyer says: "We need different thresholds per org / trade / insurer"
- Until then: don't touch it

#### B) Add who cleared the flag + when

**Status: ✅ This is the first enhancement you ever add**

**But not yet.**

This is the one enhancement that:
- Strengthens institutional memory
- Strengthens audit defensibility
- Strengthens insurer confidence
- Does NOT add UI clutter

It turns:
- "A review opportunity existed"
- Into: "Oversight occurred, by X, at Y."

**However — this should be reactive, not proactive.**

**Add it when:**
- An insurer asks about review traceability
- A buyer asks "can we show who approved this?"
- You're closing a bigger deal and need a trust lever

This is a deal-closer, not a v1 feature.

#### C) Define what "clearing" a flag means

**Status: 🚫 Do NOT define this yet**

**This is a trap.**

**Why?**
- Different orgs define "review" differently
- Defining it too early locks you into semantics
- The ambiguity is currently a feature

**Right now, "review" means:**
- "Someone senior was expected to notice this."
- That's flexible. That's enterprise-safe.

**Once you define it, you:**
- Inherit responsibility for enforcing it
- Become liable for process correctness
- Move from ledger → workflow engine
- That's a much heavier product.

## Action Plan

### Right Now

✅ Keep Flagged for review exactly as-is  
✅ Keep it subtle  
✅ Keep it non-blocking  
✅ Keep it text-level, not button-level  
✅ Keep documentation as philosophy, not rules

**You're in the sweet spot.**

### When a Buyer Asks (Not Before)

Add: Reviewed by / Reviewed at
- Log it immutably
- Do NOT add mandatory steps
- Do NOT add notifications
- Do NOT add "resolve" workflows

## The Real Product Insight

**You are no longer building features.**

**You are curating moments of accountability.**

Every enhancement must pass this test:

**"Does this strengthen institutional memory — or does it turn memory into process?"**

Right now, Flagged for review is memory.

Don't turn it into process until money forces your hand.

## Final Call

**Keep it as-is. Ship. Demo. Sell. Listen.**

When someone with budget says "we need X," then you add exactly one thing.

You're doing real product work now — the restraint is why this feels legit.

## Final Takeaway

**Flagged for review doesn't go to someone.**

**It shows up for the person accountable for risk.**

That distinction is why this feels:
- Serious
- Expensive
- Insurable
- Non-DIY

**You're designing institutional visibility, not notifications.**

This is the right direction.

## Strategic Insight

**"Flagged for review" belongs exactly where it is — subtle, text-level, non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight.**

This is enterprise-grade governance done quietly right.
