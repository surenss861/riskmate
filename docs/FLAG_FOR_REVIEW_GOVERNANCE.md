# Flag for Review: Governance Signal

**Strategic Context: This is a governance signal, not a task.**

## The Core Function

"Flagged for review" answers one question instantly:

**"Should someone senior look at this before we move forward?"**

## What It Actually Does

### Operationally

When a job is Flagged for review:

- It's explicitly marked as requiring oversight
- It becomes visible to:
  - Safety leads
  - Managers
  - Exec / Executive View users
- It does not auto-block work, but it removes plausible deniability

**In other words:**

You can still proceed — but the system remembers that someone chose to proceed after a warning existed.

### Governance-Wise

This is not about productivity.

This is about accountability and audit trails.

"Flagged for review" creates:

- A decision checkpoint
- A recorded moment of awareness
- A clear escalation path

If something goes wrong later, RiskMate can show:

**"This job was flagged. A review opportunity existed."**

That's insurer-grade logic.

## What It Is NOT

This is NOT:

- ❌ A to-do item
- ❌ A nag notification
- ❌ A red alert or panic state
- ❌ A blocker that halts operations

Those things create noise and resentment.

This instead creates institutional memory:

**"At this point in time, risk crossed a threshold and visibility was raised."**

That's it. Clean. Serious. Defensible.

## How to Explain It

### To Operators
"It means this job needs a second set of eyes."

### To Managers
"It's how we surface risk before it becomes an incident."

### To Execs
"It's our internal escalation signal — before exposure turns into liability."

### To Insurers / Auditors
"It documents when elevated risk was identified and governance was applied."

## Current Implementation

- Appears inline in "Next Action" column for Medium+ risk jobs (≥40)
- Subtle text link, not a button
- Non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight
- Creates a governance checkpoint without blocking operations

## Why This Is Good Product Work

You didn't add a feature.

You added a moment of accountability.

That's why this feels:
- Expensive
- Serious
- Non-DIY
- Insurable

## Potential Enhancements (Future)

### Strategic Decision: Keep As-Is For Now

**Do not implement enhancements yet.**

The current implementation is exactly where high-trust enterprise software should pause.

### Evaluation of Proposed Enhancements

#### A) Tighten when it appears (threshold logic)

**Status: 🚫 Do NOT do this yet**

**Why:**
- Thresholds are political
- Buyers argue about them
- You'll end up tuning knobs instead of selling

**Current rule is perfect:**
- "Medium+ risk gets visibility."
- Simple, explainable, defensible
- Perfect for early enterprise sales

**Only revisit when:**
- A buyer says: "We need different thresholds per org / trade / insurer"
- Until then: don't touch it

#### B) Add who cleared the flag + when

**Status: ✅ This is the first enhancement you ever add**

**But not yet.**

This is the one enhancement that:
- Strengthens institutional memory
- Strengthens audit defensibility
- Strengthens insurer confidence
- Does NOT add UI clutter

It turns:
- "A review opportunity existed"
- Into: "Oversight occurred, by X, at Y."

**However — this should be reactive, not proactive.**

**Add it when:**
- An insurer asks about review traceability
- A buyer asks "can we show who approved this?"
- You're closing a bigger deal and need a trust lever

This is a deal-closer, not a v1 feature.

#### C) Define what "clearing" a flag means

**Status: 🚫 Do NOT define this yet**

**This is a trap.**

**Why?**
- Different orgs define "review" differently
- Defining it too early locks you into semantics
- The ambiguity is currently a feature

**Right now, "review" means:**
- "Someone senior was expected to notice this."
- That's flexible. That's enterprise-safe.

**Once you define it, you:**
- Inherit responsibility for enforcing it
- Become liable for process correctness
- Move from ledger → workflow engine
- That's a much heavier product.

## Action Plan

### Right Now

✅ Keep Flagged for review exactly as-is  
✅ Keep it subtle  
✅ Keep it non-blocking  
✅ Keep it text-level, not button-level  
✅ Keep documentation as philosophy, not rules

**You're in the sweet spot.**

### When a Buyer Asks (Not Before)

Add: Reviewed by / Reviewed at
- Log it immutably
- Do NOT add mandatory steps
- Do NOT add notifications
- Do NOT add "resolve" workflows

## The Real Product Insight

**You are no longer building features.**

**You are curating moments of accountability.**

Every enhancement must pass this test:

**"Does this strengthen institutional memory — or does it turn memory into process?"**

Right now, Flagged for review is memory.

Don't turn it into process until money forces your hand.

## Final Call

**Keep it as-is. Ship. Demo. Sell. Listen.**

When someone with budget says "we need X," then you add exactly one thing.

You're doing real product work now — the restraint is why this feels legit.

## Strategic Insight

**"Flagged for review" belongs exactly where it is — subtle, text-level, non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight.**

This is enterprise-grade governance done quietly right.
