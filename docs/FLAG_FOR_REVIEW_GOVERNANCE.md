# Flag for Review: Governance Signal

**Strategic Context: This is a governance signal, not a task.**

## The Core Function

"Flagged for review" answers one question instantly:

**"Should someone senior look at this before we move forward?"**

## What It Actually Does

### Operationally

When a job is Flagged for review:

- It's explicitly marked as requiring oversight
- It becomes visible to:
  - Safety leads
  - Managers
  - Exec / Executive View users
- It does not auto-block work, but it removes plausible deniability

**In other words:**

You can still proceed — but the system remembers that someone chose to proceed after a warning existed.

### Governance-Wise

This is not about productivity.

This is about accountability and audit trails.

"Flagged for review" creates:

- A decision checkpoint
- A recorded moment of awareness
- A clear escalation path

If something goes wrong later, RiskMate can show:

**"This job was flagged. A review opportunity existed."**

That's insurer-grade logic.

## What It Is NOT

This is NOT:

- ❌ A to-do item
- ❌ A nag notification
- ❌ A red alert or panic state
- ❌ A blocker that halts operations

Those things create noise and resentment.

This instead creates institutional memory:

**"At this point in time, risk crossed a threshold and visibility was raised."**

That's it. Clean. Serious. Defensible.

## How to Explain It

### To Operators
"It means this job needs a second set of eyes."

### To Managers
"It's how we surface risk before it becomes an incident."

### To Execs
"It's our internal escalation signal — before exposure turns into liability."

### To Insurers / Auditors
"It documents when elevated risk was identified and governance was applied."

## Current Implementation

- Appears inline in "Next Action" column for Medium+ risk jobs (≥40)
- Subtle text link, not a button
- Non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight
- Creates a governance checkpoint without blocking operations

## Why This Is Good Product Work

You didn't add a feature.

You added a moment of accountability.

That's why this feels:
- Expensive
- Serious
- Non-DIY
- Insurable

## Potential Enhancements (Future)

1. **Tighten when it appears** (threshold logic)
   - Currently: Medium+ risk (≥40)
   - Could be: Configurable per organization
   - Could be: Based on risk trend (↑ increasing)

2. **Add who cleared the flag + when**
   - Record who reviewed and when
   - Add to audit trail
   - Show in job history

3. **Define what clearing a flag actually means**
   - What actions clear the flag?
   - Does it require approval?
   - What's the risk ledger state after clearing?

## Strategic Insight

**"Flagged for review" belongs exactly where it is — subtle, text-level, non-alarmist, but impossible to ignore in hindsight.**

This is enterprise-grade governance done quietly right.
