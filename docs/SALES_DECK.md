# RiskMate Sales Deck

**Risk governance you can prove**

Live enforcement. Audit-ready by design.

---

## Slide 1: Title

**RiskMate**

Risk governance you can prove

*Subline: Live enforcement. Audit-ready by design.*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Risk isn't the problem.**

**Unprovable risk management is.**

- Spreadsheets don't enforce anything
- PM tools don't log authority
- Safety systems don't survive audits
- Insurance wants proof, not screenshots

---

## Slide 3: What RiskMate Actually Is

**RiskMate is an enforcement layer for operational risk.**

**Not:**
- A checklist app
- A document dump
- A reporting tool

**But:**
- Role-aware
- Audit-logged
- Scenario-ready
- Insurance-defensible

---

## Slide 4: The Governance Model

**Governance is the product.**

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|------------------|
| Owner | Full authority, billing, org settings |
| Admin | Governance control, enforcement |
| Safety Lead | Flagging, mitigation oversight |
| Executive | Visibility, escalation |
| Member | Execution only |

**Every denied action is logged.**

*This directly maps to: Role switcher, auth.role_violation events, Disabled actions in demo*

---

## Slide 5: Risk in Motion

**Every job is continuously risk-scored.**

- Low / Medium / High risk
- Flagged jobs escalate automatically
- Visibility changes by role
- No manual chasing

*This slide literally matches the Job Roster UI.*

---

## Slide 6: Audit Trail

**Every action creates evidence.**

- Who acted
- What they attempted
- Whether it succeeded
- Why it was allowed or denied
- Timestamped and immutable

**Including violations.**

*This is where competitors lose.*

---

## Slide 7: Scenarios That Matter

**Mirror your scenario picker exactly:**

- **Normal Operations** — day-to-day visibility
- **Audit Review** — prove enforcement
- **Incident** — escalation trail
- **Insurance Packet** — completed jobs only

Same system. Different lenses.

---

## Slide 8: Billing & Security

**Operational data and billing are intentionally separated.**

- Stripe manages billing
- RiskMate governs operations
- Security events are logged
- Access changes are auditable

*This explains why your billing screen looks the way it does.*

---

## Slide 9: Who This Is Built For

**RiskMate is for teams where mistakes are expensive.**

- Construction & trades
- Property & facilities
- Regulated operations
- Insurance-sensitive businesses

**If audits matter, RiskMate fits.**

---

## Slide 10: The Demo Isn't a Simulation

**What you saw is production logic.**

- Same roles
- Same permissions
- Same audit behavior
- Persistence disabled by design

**You didn't watch a demo.**

**You used the product.**

---

## Slide 11: Close

**RiskMate doesn't help you manage risk.**

**It helps you prove you did.**

**Buttons:**
- Request Access
- View Demo Again

---

## Key Talking Points

1. **Governance is the product** — not a feature, not an add-on
2. **Enforcement, not tracking** — capabilities are server-enforced
3. **Audit-ready by design** — every action creates evidence
4. **Role-aware from day one** — not retrofitted permissions
5. **Insurance-defensible** — what you saw in the demo is what protects you

**This deck mirrors the demo exactly. Use it to explain what buyers just experienced.**
