# pnpm configuration
# Note: The build scripts warning is informational and won't block the build.
# This is pnpm's security feature. The packages (@tsparticles/engine, @vercel/speed-insights,
# react-tsparticles, sharp, tsparticles-engine, unrs-resolver) are safe and trusted.
# To suppress the warning locally, run: pnpm approve-builds
# On Vercel, this warning can be safely ignored as it doesn't affect the build.
